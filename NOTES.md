Hi,

Thanks for reviewing this submission.

I hope the functionality covers the given AC's

I've included unit tests of the `Game` class and used e2e tests with Cypress for the UI itself.

I kept the design and mark up simple so there isnt a lot of CSS or responsive complexity here however I hope the solution meets the resposive, accessibily and compatability requirements. (I manually tested on Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari and checked out the lighthouse score)

Run `yarn run e2e` for end-to-end tests
